The following CSS rule uses the `calc()` function incorrectly, leading to unexpected behavior:

```css
.element { width: calc(100% - 20px); }
```

This will work as expected in most browsers. However, some older or less-common browsers might struggle to parse this correctly. The main problem is that the `calc()` function requires spaces around the arithmetic operator (`-` in this case). So, correct code is:

```css
.element { width: calc(100% - 20px); }
```
